# Treble-Portfolio
Professional Roblox scripting portfolio
*By Treble (@losttreble#8848)*

I’m Treble — a full-stack Roblox scripter specializing in building studio-grade, production-ready systems from scratch. With over 2 years of professional experience and hundreds of hours spent refining my craft, I deliver secure, scalable, and polished gameplay systems that keep players engaged and games growing.

From frame-perfect combat frameworks to advanced AI, monetization systems, and modular backends, my code is built to handle long-term content expansion without breaking under pressure. I work on both client and server with equal fluency, ensuring smooth gameplay, airtight security, and clean, maintainable code.

If you need someone who can take a feature from idea to launch, integrate seamlessly with your team, and deliver results that scale, that’s exactly what I do.

Most recently, I’ve delivered Clone Battles and a range of advanced AI, progression, and monetization systems that demonstrate both technical depth and player-focused design.

## 🧬 Trait System — Game-Changing Unit Customization
This isn’t just a “buff and debuff” system — it’s a plug-and-play trait framework designed to give your game limitless replay value. Every trait can dynamically alter stats, swap abilities, and even apply unique visual effects — all handled server-side for security.

Why it matters: Traits aren’t just cosmetic — they’re engagement hooks. When players log in wondering “What crazy build can I make today?”, retention skyrockets. This system makes that possible without spaghetti code or messy one-off scripts.

Core Advantages:

Dynamic Runtime Effects – Traits apply instantly when units spawn, affecting stats, abilities, or visuals.

Exploit-Proof Architecture – Server-authoritative logic keeps trait effects safe from manipulation.

Fully Modular – Add, remove, or tweak traits without touching core combat code.

Supports All Playstyles – Passive effects, trigger-based boosts, and multi-trait stacking supported.

##  Advanced AI System — Smart Patrols & Dynamic Behavior
Keeps gameplay alive by ensuring enemies act like threats, not props.

Why it matters:
Enemy AI isn’t just “movement logic” — it’s one of the biggest factors in whether combat feels engaging or forgettable. Most Roblox AI is predictable and boring, which kills replayability. My AI system creates enemies that feel alive by making real decisions, adapting to player actions, and keeping encounters fresh.

Key Highlights:

Patrol & Aggro Logic – Enemies roam believable paths, only engaging when players breach their aggro zone.

Dynamic Behavior Modes – Switch between Aggressive, Neutral, and Passive states to create variety and pacing.

State Machine Architecture – Prevents “AI spaghetti” and makes it easy to add new behaviors without breaking old ones.

Server-Authoritative – All logic runs on the server to prevent exploits, while smooth client feelers keep it responsive.

Scalable – Can handle dozens of enemies at once without killing performance.

Result:
This system makes every encounter dynamic, scalable, and easy to expand with new AI types. In a game with repeat combat (PvE, grinding, dungeon runs), this can directly improve player retention by keeping fights from feeling repetitive.

## ⚔️ Modular Frame-Based Combat — Precision, Fluidity, & Control
The core of any great action game — built for responsiveness and scalability.

Why it matters:
Combat is where players decide if a game feels good. Bad hit detection, delayed inputs, or clunky combos will make them quit instantly. My combat framework is engineered for frame-perfect execution and future-proof expandability, giving you the foundation for everything from basic PvE to competitive PvP.

Key Highlights:

Directional Dash System – Players can dodge or engage in any direction with perfect control, adding depth and skill expression.

M1 Combo State Machine – Clean, predictable combo chains that prevent animation breaking and input buffering issues.

Ability Execution with Animation Syncing – Abilities connect exactly when the animation says they should, ensuring satisfying impact.

Server-Authoritative – Hit detection and damage are validated server-side for anti-exploit reliability.

Modular Controller Design – Want to add new attacks, abilities, or mechanics? Drop them in without rewriting core systems.

Result:
This combat system doesn’t just “work” — it feels responsive and rewarding, while being easy for devs to expand over time. Whether you’re making an anime battler, RPG, or arena PvP game, this is the kind of combat players will talk about after they log off.

local function isLocked(player: Player, slot: number): boolean
	local map: SlotTimestampMap? = ActiveCloneSpawn[player]
	local v: number? = map and map[slot]
	if v == nil then
		return false
	end
	-- timestamp-based lock with timeout to avoid deadlocks
